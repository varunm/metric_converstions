# MetricConversions
==========
These are a set of methods for length, volume, temperature, area and the like that help a user convert to or from English units to Metric units.  This was done as a class exercise in 67-275 at Carnegie Mellon University, with a pair of students tackling each of the submodules and writing the necessary tests.


Installation
------------

Each submodule of the gem has a set of basic tests associated with it.  The tests provide other examples of what is possible using this methods and may help the user further understand how this gem can be applied.  The testing suite requires the minitest gem to run properly.
